# Word-Counting
I wrote this code while taking a summer course at Chalmers university.

This was the first lab, and we worked with a technique that is the found in many algorithms which allow machines to understand human language.

Machines collect statistics which allow them to make inferences which are right most of the time, even when the machine lacks real understanding. The most basic statistics is plain word counting.
